# 🐢 Turtle Race

This is a fun little racing game built with Python’s `turtle` module. It was part of my learning journey through the 100 Days of Python course.

The idea is simple: you pick a turtle color, and then watch as all the turtles race across the screen. The winner is randomly determined using Python’s `random` module.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The game opens a window with 6 colored turtles lined up at the starting line.
- You’re prompted to place a bet by choosing a turtle color.
- Once the race begins, each turtle moves forward by a random amount until one crosses the finish line.
- The game prints whether you won or lost based on your color choice.

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Creating multiple turtles using loops and functions
- Handling user input with `screen.textinput()`
- Animating with loops and `random.randint()`
- Managing game state with flags like `is_race_on`
- Writing clean, modular code

## 💡 Next Steps

I plan to improve this project by:
- Adding a visual finish line
- Animating confetti or effects when a turtle wins
- Allowing multiple rounds of racing
